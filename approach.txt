I felt the best way to approach this problem was to use a depth level search
to check child nodes against p or q.

I did this by making a catch for the case that root is null.

Then I wanted to check if the root itself was p or q.

Next I make the two recursive calls to search each subtree (the left side of the tree and the right)

In each search we are trying to find p and q and we are checking if the current node it self is null.
We have to do this step many times so that is why I chose a recursive solution.

Now we have to make catches for if the left and right nodes we recursivley called in the last line
are null or not.

If they are both not null we can simply return the root. 

But if one if null and the other is not we simply return the non null node.
